    <h1>Kicks against Cancer</h1>

    <p>About the program:
       <p></p> Ryan, Annie, and Alessandro Frigerio will be running 5 soccer sessions the week of 6/16-6/19. 
       We are hoping to participate in Dana-Farber Cancer Institute's Pan Mass Challenge, a charity bikeride for cancer research. 
       Our goal is to raise $5000, and we hope to accomplish this goal partly through the proceeds of this clinic. 
       All proceeds of this program will go to Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and although we have no official charge,
        we recommend a donation of $35 per evening session and $75 for the Thursday 9am-12pm session. If full day childcare is needed for Thursday June 19th, 
        please reach out to us so that we can accomadate your needs.
       
        <p></p>        About us:
      <p></p> Ryan is 20, Annie is 17, and Alessandro is 15. We all are very passionate about soccer, and between the three of us, 
      we have extensive experience playing soccer in the MLS Next, NAL, and ECNL leagues. Ryan and Annie have lifeguarding experience 
      and are CPR certified, and we all have extensive experience working with children. Federico Frigerio, who is a volunteer Brookline soccer coach, 
      will also be on site during the sessions.  </p>
