    <h1>Score against Cancer </h1>

    <p>About the program:
       <p></p> 
       Soccer training sessions for children ages 5-10 on Monday June 16th, Tues June 17th, Wed June 18th, Thursday June 19th from 6-7:30 PM.
       Juneteenth camp from 9 AM-12 PM on Thursday June 19th. Childcare available in the afternooon for those who neeed it.
       You can sign up for as many or as few sessions as you would like, and you can also sign up for the Juneteenth camp.
       The sessions will be held at Soule Field in Brookline (evening sessions) and Skyline Park in Brookline (Juneteenth camp) and will include soccer drills, games, and scrimmages.
       All proceeds will go to Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and we are hoping to raise $5000 through this program.

       Ryan, Annie, and Alessandro Frigerio will be running 5 soccer sessions the week of 6/16-6/19. 
       We are hoping to participate in Dana-Farber Cancer Institute's Pan Mass Challenge, a charity bike ride for cancer research and treatment. 
       Our goal is to raise $5000, and we hope to accomplish this goal partly through the proceeds of this clinic. 
       All proceeds of this program will go to Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and although we have no official charge, we recommend a donation of $35 per evening session and $75 for the Thursday 9am-12pm session. If full day childcare is needed for Thursday June 19th, 
        please reach out to us so that we can accomadate your needs.
